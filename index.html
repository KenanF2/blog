            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kenan Flemming and I am trying to get into the tech world. I have recently joined a coding course with Code Nation. My interest in tech and IT comes from a computing and gaming background, as I have always enjoyed IT ever since my school days.

            <p>
                Technology primarily affects the ability of a company to communicate with customers. In today's busy business environment, employees need to interact quickly and clearly with customers. Websites enable customers to find answers after hours to their queries. Fast shipping options enable businesses to move items over a broad geographic area. Business benefits when consumers use technology to communicate with a company because better communication develops a better public reputation.[2]

            <p>
                Technology also motivates a company to recognize it's requirements for revenue and maintain valuable resources like time and physical space. Warehouse inventory technologies enable business owners to comprehend how best to control a product's storage costs.With the correct systems in place, managers can also save money and time because instead of being at corporate headquarters they can save time by holding meetings over the Internet.[2]

                Technology generates a vibrant squad within a company because staff at distinct places have stronger relationships.If factory executives can interact with delivery coordinators at a varying places, conflicts and suspicion are less probable to develop.Cliques and personal conflicts can become a nightmare for a company ; innovation often enables employees set aside their unique backgrounds.[2]

                Most modern-day companies are susceptible to threats to security and vandalism. Technology can be used to safeguard economic data, managerial private choices and other proprietary information leading to competitive benefits. Simply put, technology enables companies to keep  their thoughts and ideas away from their competition.By getting computers with passwords, a company can guarantee that the competition will not copy any of its upcoming initiatives.[2]

            <h2 id="whydodig">Why do Digital Projects Fail?</h2>
            <div>
            <h4>Lack of expertise
            </h4>
            <p>Digital projects can fail due to a lack of expertise in the cross-functional aspects. Some make the mistake of believing that only “digital people” are needed for digital projects. However all digital projects have a need for someone with skills in business process management to assist the team in assessing and planning the alignment between the back-end operational processes and the customer journey.[3]
            </p>
            <h4>Limited digital strategy
            </h4>
            <p>A lot of digital projects are concentrated completely on the objective of a single initiative or department, instead of contributing to the company’s digital strategy and business goals overall. Specifically define what the project's success looks like and how it contributes to the business strategy before the company starts moving forward.[3]
            </p>
            <h4>Fixed Plans
            </h4>
            <p>The notion of a “5-year-plan” is a fixed plan that doesn’t account for change, which is not practical these days when other projects make improvements over time. Using iterative processes that are Agile and allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the primary method to make sure that your success is lasts. Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.[3]
            </p>
            <h4>Overambition
            </h4>
            <p>Expecting the project to be perfect on the first build attempt instead of thinking that done is better than perfect can lead to projects that drag on way past their expected completion time. Instead you should try releasing a “Minimum Viable Product”, so consumers can have early versions of the project that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. Having a goal of releasing a perfect site in 3 months is not realistic without a real business plan trying to succeed this way is sure to fail.[3]
            </p>
            <h4>Steps for choosing software and IT systems that are right for your business
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                        Know your objective (or “What’s the point?”) Firstly you need to know what you want the software to be doing for you. How will the software save costs and save time on the project.
                </li>
                <li>
        
                                Create a list of software requirements 
                                <br>Functional requirements - List of what you need the software to do. [4]
                                <br>Usability requirements - Check if the software is easy enough to use for your team’s skill set/level and if these types of software are something they are used to or can get used to easily.[4]
                                <br>Technological preferences - Decide what kind of systems you want to work on like Mac or windows do you want it be stored on premises or in the cloud etc. You should have an Idea of where you want it.[4]
                               <br>Budgetary requirements. - Set a budget to know how much you’re willing to pay for the systems and know how much to pay for these systems to save your business money A.K.A Return on investment (ROI).[4]
                                <br>Reporting requirements - Decide whether you need reports from your systems and If so, what needs to be included? Should these be presented as dashboards, or emailed to you?[4]
                                <br>Scalability requirements. - What scale is your business at and do you expect this volume to increase over the next 2 to 5 years?[4]
                                <br>Vendor requirements - Make sure you know all the requirements of the supplier themselves. Perhaps this includes the support response times, current user volumes, years in business, or the vendor’s roadmap for future development.[4]
                        <li>
                                Start searching for relevant applications - Start looking for apps and sites that may have information about you’re software because the most popular ones may not be the best fit for your project. Use reliable software comparison sites to get a list of competitors.[4]
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Start excluding solutions - You can start getting rid of software options that don’t meet your requirements, for example if the software only works on Windows and the team is working on Macs you can exclude that solution, also if the software is too expensive you can exclude it. Once the list has been whittled down you can trial the rest of the systems to see which one is the most suitable for your needs.[4]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Start trialling your selected software - Trialling the software to check it against your usability requirements is the best way to see if a system is suitable for you. Find out the systems learnability, efficiency, satisfaction, errors and the memorability[4]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Do your due diligence - You should know which systems you want to use so now you should investigate your resellers and address your vendor requirements that you have listed.[4]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Start negotiating - At this stage this is where you start to finalise the finer details of the system. Make sure you address the business issues, such as, support levels, implementation times, iservice availability and payment terms – not just price. When talking final prices you should include likely costs as some resellers and vendors are more flexible on prices.[4]
                        </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                To successfully create a project you need to use great task management so that you can complete everything needed and don’t forget any features you wanted to add to the project. To assist with your project management you can use a tool called Trello, which is an app that utilises the kanban planning method to clearly map out what you need to do, what you are doing, and what has been done. You need good planning skills to properly complete a project so doing research and keeping a record of it will help you to make informed decisions on what you plan to do in your project.

            <p>
                Trello - This is an app that helps with task management and allows people to make cards with an objective to complete.
                    Trello makes use of the kanban system to make it easy to manage tasks and make the layout look as simple as possible.
                    The Trello app also allows you to add comments and attachments to cards
                    <br>Git and Git Hub - Git and Git Hub helped me to manage my project through the repository that keeps track of changes that are made. This is helpful because it gives you access to who made the changes, when the changes were made and it also shows what was changed.If I had a team project I would be able to see who changed what in the project so I can give proper feedback because I can see exactly what they have done. If somebody made a mistake in the project I can look through the changes and make the appropriate edit to the project. I was able to to link my project folder to Git Hub, which allowed me to send new commits to the repository everytime I made a change to my project.

            <h4>Obtaining Consent
            </h4>
            <p>
                Active opt-in – Consent will require a positive opt-in through clear affirmative action. Pre-ticked boxes, for example, will no longer be compliant.[5]
                        Granular – Blanket consent will not be compliant. Individuals should be able to know as much information about their data that is being processed as possible.The best way to ensure this would be to allow individuals to withdraw consent from each of the processing activities.[5]
                        Unbundling – Consent should not be a precondition of signing up to a service unless necessary such as a newspaper subscription. Consent requests have to be separated from the terms and conditions.It should also be clear to the individual whether there will be third parties processing their data other than the people they are signing up to.[5]
            </p>
            <h4>Digital Marketing</h4>
            <p>
                The final area GDPR is set to impact digital marketing is data processing. Digital marketers will only be able to process the data they really require, they would need legal justification for the reason why they are processing the collected data.[5]

            <h2 id="constraintsaffectingwebsites">Constraints affecting websites</h2>
            <p>
                Website Colors - The colours used on your website are important, as your viewers may be able to see everything clearly on an LCD monitor may not be as clear and appealing when viewed on an older monitor. Choosing the wrong colour can also mean that some things are not readable, like having a bright coloured font that blends into the background would be bad for a website.[6]
                Typeface Limitations - Not all computers are able to display all fonts, so if a viewer comes to your page, that is displaying a font that is unavailable to them, they will be shown a substitute font. This substitute font can distort your page and throw off the design making it look not aesthetically pleasing.[6]
                Internet Limitations - Having really well designed web pages, with great animations and interactive options can be great, however this can make the page take a long time to download. People with slower connections to the internet will have a hard time running a website like this with so many features to download they may experience freezing and prolonged loading times, which will leave them dissatisfied.[6]
                Display Limitations - The website display itself can be seen as a constraint for the website. The design must comply with as many browsers as possible, not to mention making it mobile-friendly for viewers that are visiting from their phones. You can reach a bigger audience if the websites display works well for more people.[6]
                Copyright - A constraint to your website may be copyright, as there are media and information that are protected by copyrights. If you infringe these copyright laws you can receive fines of up to £50,000/$65,000 or even possibly face incarceration. However if you copyright your website people may still be able to use your media and information under fair-use and would require no permissions from you the owner of the copyrighted work.[6]

            <p>
                Visually impaired - To cater to the visually impaired you can make sure colours are well contrasted and easily differentiable to people with colorblindness. It is also a good idea to use more than one differentiator, for example, colour and underline or block capitals. Dynamic type lettering (lettering that can be increased in size to suit the use) is the simplest way you can make your website accessible to low-vision users.
            
                Hearing impaired - Having captions or subtitles for media like videos and audio files would be an important part of catering to the hearing impaired and make it easier for them to access things on your web page. It is important to keep descriptions brief and use lots of verbs. There are web extensions you can use to get a report on your site. They can run a multitude of tests and report back any problems but they may not catch everything so it is important you try user testing and see if there are any problems you can notice for yourself.
                
                Motor disability - Including menus and any other choices available on a site can be difficult for people with motor disabilities if the buttons and links are too small so making larger touch buttons is a huge help to people with motor disease. Single touch options on your website would also be very beneficial.

                    CSS files are a tool that deals with the aesthetics of a web page. It helps to colour and divide your page to look more presentable to the public. CSS files can be created or edited in any text-editor, like Notepad.[7]
                    
                    .HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file

    <p>
            The use of Trello was very efficient because whenever I was unsure of what task I was on I would check my cards to see what was in the ‘doing’ section of my Trello board, and once finished I can move it to the ‘Done’ section. After every task was completed I would simply look through the the tasks that were in the ‘To do’ section and decide which one I should start first. 
            Trello was the appropriate app to plan out how I was going to make the website because It allows me to access the information that needs to be done from home as well as in my workplace. Having the ability to access Trello from home increases the the amount of time I can potentially be spending on the project drastically. 
            A benefit of using Trello was the simple layout of the app helping me to see the information that I needed for my project. Also another benefit would be that the cards are customizable, therefore making them even easier to see what cards need to be done and if in a team it helps to show who needs to do each card. A drawback of Trello is that the notifications don’t show all the time while you are not in the app and only a few notifications are pushed to your email, so if you are away from the project and the app you may not know what is going on with the project. Also another drawback to the Trello app would be that the cards could only have a small selection of labels and they were preset labels. It would be helpful to have custom labels so you can add different pictures to the label or have more than just initials to show, who’s been assigned that task.
            
            <br>Visual Studio Code was my choice for the coding of the HTML and CSS of my website. It was very easy to use as it was the source-code editor that I was most familiar with. So Visual Studio Code held all the code that pertained to my blog website so there was only one place I needed to look when trying to edit the aesthetics or information on the website. I used Visual Studio Code to input all my information, including headers, paragraphs and images. I also used CSS within Visual Studio Code to edit the font colours, font sizes, image dimensions. I also imported Google fonts within the CSS section of Visual Studio Code. 
            Visual Studio Code was appropriate for the project of making my website because it allowed me to edit every aspect of the page layout and include all the information that I wanted on my blog page.
            A benefit of Visual Studio Code is that they highlight your codes in different colours, and if there is something wrong with your codes Visual Studio Code will highlight the code red and have a small description of what the problem is at the bottom. Also a benefit of using Visual Studio Code would be that it recognizes code and gives multiple suggestions making it way faster to type code in their program. A drawback of Visual Studio Code is that it doesn’t support all languages without using third party interpreter extensions. Another drawback of Visual Studio Code is that the launch time and file searches are slower than than a few other similar source-code editors.
            Overall the website could have been made more efficiently if I had more time to implement other features like, buttons and navigation features on my website. If I had more time I would have had features that were aligned using flexbox and I would have been able to use way more skills within my Virtual Studio Code, while using HTML and CSS. If this project was done in a team it would be more efficient because multiple cards on trello can be in the doing section at a time because there is more than one person working on the tasks, all the planning will be completed faster. Working in a team to make the website would have saved a lot of time and allowed more time for adding additional features to the page.
            
           <br> With all things considered I am happy with my website because all of the information is clear and separated by headers so that it doesn’t just look like too much information lumped onto a page. Also the information and images are the right dimensions and don’t feel too big or too small. The things I don’t like about the website and would change if I did it again is the background and margins. I would have liked to have some background designs and pictures or links in the margins of the page to make the page look less bare in those areas.
            A further improvement that I could have made was having designed a section like a ‘contact me’ section, where all my social media links are and maybe an email for inquiries.
            
            <br>I could improve the productivity and efficiency of the making and planning of this project by setting self-imposed or team-imposed deadlines for tasks to be completed. I would also try to not multitask as much as I did during this project and focus more on singular tasks doin them one at a time to give them my full concentration. To improve productivity and efficiency during the project I would set aside more time to do tasks at home. 
            To improve my productivity when using IT in digital projects next time I will work in a team so that tasks can be divided and and shared between multiple people, which would ease the workload. I could also use the Slack app to communicate with other team members on the project from home or in the workplace links and information to help them with their tasks and ask for help on my own tasks if needed. Next time I would also do stand-ups for team members to update each other of where they are up to in their work and what ideas they have chosen to implement so they can ask for suggestions.
            I would test digital solutions by debugging and constantly looking at my website to see if I can notice any mistakes within the page layout, how things look, and where things are located. If I was working in a team we would be able to do more user testing because everybody would be able to view the website and give feedback on what they may think is wrong with the website so changes can be made before we release it and it goes live.
